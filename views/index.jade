          | I am a college sophomore studying computer science and business. I love to attend concerts,
          | eat japanese food, and go to hackathons. I am currently
          | on the east coast for school but plan to return to San Francisco after graduation.

      | I developed an interest in technology during senior year when I joined the FIRST
      | robotics team at my high school as an engineering lead. Prior to that, I had a stronger interest in
      | mathematics and would frequently participate in competitions across the west coast.
      | I did not start programming until college, but I enjoy it very much and spend much of my spare
      | time coding.

      | My goals in life are to be happy, have a challenging and productive career
      | in technology, and surrounding myself with awesome people.

      | In my spare time, I like to browse reddit while eating cheetos. I also enjoy
      | playing volleyball, reading the news or trying out new resturants. You can learn more about me
      | by contacting me here or finding me on facebook.
